# Let's make something cool!!!!
## Why we love BeautifulSoup :heart::ramen::heart:
- It is a **powerful** parsing library in python.
- Common use case: parsing through HTML to get some neat info.
- It tastes good.

##### What could we do?
- [ ] Let's make a request to a url.
- [ ] Parse through that entire HTML in cool lxml style.
- [ ] Make our output look sick.

#### Oh, wow, ok. But what do I need?!!??!
- You need the following:
```bash
import bs4 as bs
from urllib.request import Request, urlopen
```

##### That's it.
