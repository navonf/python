# Python workshop

## Hey you, are you learning python?
This is my repo for learning python, whether it be introductory,
complex, web APIs, SDKs the list will (hopefully) go on and on.

## Cool introductory! :sparkles:
### file: python_workshop.py
### level: beginner
This file contains some introductory things including data types,
lists, list comprehension.. etc.

Run in the terminal:
> Remember to run the commands in your project directory..
> tip: ex: "cd Documents/Workspace/Git" to change directories

``` bash
python3 current_stock_prices.py
```

> if "python3" does not work, try just "python"

## Web scraper using BeautifulSoup4 to scrape stock prices :rocket:

and AMZN (my usuals). Please feel free to edit and add your own.
